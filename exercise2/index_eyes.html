            <img src="eyes.JPEG" alt="Eye Safety Advertisement">
            <p>The image called eyes appears to be an advertisement promoting eye safety for workers in Illinois. It is specifically telling people to, “save your eyes, use your goggles”. The design of it looks very modern and cartoonish. The main colors are black, brown, yellow, and white. This is a very confusing picture because I can’t tell what is happening in the back with the three male silhouettes. The picture is saying to save your eyes, but to whom it is directed to is unclear, unless it is directed to everybody. Overall, this image is very sleek but could use some more clarity for who it is directed to.</p>
