				<p>Hi there, I'm Tyler! Thanks for checking out my website!</p>
				<p>I first fell in love with music when I was just three years old or so. My parents took me to a wedding, which had a band playing during the reception. I was too young to remember any of this, but according to my family, I spent the whole time staring at the drumset, watching the drummer play. After that, my parents bought me a cheap kid's drumset, and I began to play music.</p>
				<p>Over the years, my preference shifted from playing music to writing music (though I still played in my high school's marching band and such). When I was younger, the only music I listened to was either whatever was playing in my parents' car, or the music I heard in the games I played. When I first started using the internet and learned that most of the music in these games was being made by just one person, as well as seeing people on Youtube write and play their own music, it inspired me to try it for myself.</p>
				<p>As I got older and got access to music streaming services, I started listening to a wide variety of artists. Some of my favorites to this day are artists like Kendrick Lamar, Tyler, the Creator, MF DOOM, Denzel Curry, Gorillaz, Daft Punk, Justice, Tame Impala, Radiohead, Nirvana, System of a Down, My Chemical Romance, Paramore, and Jamiroquai, among countless others. I still love plenty of the music in video games, and one of my lifelong dreams is to write the soundtrack to one someday.</p>
