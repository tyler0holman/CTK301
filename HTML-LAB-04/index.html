  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
    <p>I'm Tyler Holman. I'm currently a sophomore at <em>Illinois State University</em> studying <em>Audio and Music Production</em>.</p>
  
  <h2>My Favorite Websites</h2>

   <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a> is very likely my most visited website of all time. I love watching videos about my favorite subjects, as well as learning about things completely new to me.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/" target="_blank">AOTY</a> is a music rating website where users can go and catalogue albums that they've listened to.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.backloggd.com/" target="_blank">Backloggd</a> is very similar to the above, but for video games.</li>
   </ul>
